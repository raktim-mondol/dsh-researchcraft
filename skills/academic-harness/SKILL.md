description: "Write, revise, and verify academic LaTeX (literature reviews, journal/conference papers, grants, theses, rebuttals) with Academic Harness on DeepSeek Harness. Use when the workspace has ah.yaml, or the user asks to start, audit, plan, or fix a paper/grant/thesis in LaTeX.

# Academic Harness on DeepSeek Harness

The engine is the substitute oracle for academic writing. DeepSeek Harness is the chat. Pi is not required.

Inactive outside a directory tree with `ah.yaml`. To start: `ah_init` (new) or `ah_migrate` (existing LaTeX tree, dry-run first).

## What DSH already does in this session

- Injects the paper-state card (conventions, facts, terms, scope, thesis, briefs, blockers)
- Blocks writes to `sources/`, facts, ledger, briefs, claim records, reviews, plans, and the outline
- Blocks dropping a `%% @unit` anchor while rewriting a paragraph
- After each `write`/`edit`/`bash` that changes prose, appends the findings that edit introduced
- Loops until those findings are gone, then stops or hands off to the author

You never close a finding. Only a later check that no longer fires marks it fixed. A waiver is the author's.

## Route

| User ask | Load |
|---|---|
| Draft or rewrite a paragraph / table / figure | `ah-write-unit` |
| Add a section or argument not yet in the outline | `ah-plan-section` |
| Fix audit findings | `ah-fix-findings` |
| Review / audit a section without editing | `ah-audit-section` |
| Address reviewer or supervisor comments | `ah-revise-from-review` |

## Tools

Native `ah_*` tools (not MCP, not Pi). Prefer them over shelling out to `ah`. Do not `pip install academic-harness` and do not install it into DSH; the engine is vendored inside this plugin (`vendor/academic-harness`).

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| Coverage / "are we done" | `ah_inventory`, then `ah_check` / `ah_audit` |
| Anchors, facts macros | `ah_units`, `ah_fact` `build` |
| Evidence | `ah_source` `add`/`list`, `ah_source_search` |
| Draft | `ah_plan` → `ah_brief_new` → `ah_pack` → `edit` |
| Numbers | `ah_fact`, `ah_bind`, `ah_sweep`, `ah_fact_propose` |
| Reviews | `ah_review` `import`, `ah_review_set`, `ah_review_respond`, `ah_snapshot` |
| Provenance / AI-use | `ah_provenance`, `ah_disclosure` |
| Profiles / overlay | `ah_profile`, `ah_init`, `ah_migrate`, `ah_config`, `ah_catalogue` |

Author-only (human must have asked this message; DSH confirms): waive, accept/reject a fact, approve a brief or plan, verify a claim, decline a review item, fill provenance, approve a disclosure. You cannot do those. Call `ah_decision_request` and stop, or `ah_author` after they asked.

Numbers from data: `\fact{id}`. Cite only registered sources. Do not invent citations, numbers, or quotes. Done means inventory coverage is complete and this turn introduced no open blocker or major.
