/**
 * Academic search MCP connectors (Parallel, Firecrawl, Scite), mounted
 * programmatically instead of as static cordis.yml rows so each server's
 * auth can come from the `dsh-researchcraft-keys` settings store
 * (Settings -> ResearchCraft API keys) as well as the matching env var.
 * Resolved once when the `researchcraft` preset first mounts. That mount is
 * a STANDING composition shared by every session naming the preset for the
 * life of the running `dsh` process (see @deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets) —
 * a new chat session does NOT get a fresh mount, so a key entered or
 * changed in Settings only reaches these connectors after `dsh` itself is
 * stopped and restarted, not merely after starting a new session (verified
 * live: a freshly-saved key was still invisible to a brand-new session on
 * the correct preset). `dsh-mcp-client`'s own config is fixed per instance,
 * and env vars have the same restart requirement.
 *
 * Firecrawl works keyless (rate-limited). Parallel MCP does not: it is only
 * mounted when PARALLEL_API_KEY is set, and that key is always sent as a
 * Bearer token so it stays off the anonymous rate limit. `mcp__parallel__web_search`
 * is the same search job as native `parallel_search` but locked to `basic`
 * mode — keep it as a fallback if the REST tool is missing or fails.
 * `mcp__parallel__web_fetch` is the extract/read-URL half, not a search tool.
 * Per-call turbo/fast/basic/advanced selection is `parallel-search.js`.
 * Scite requires a key:
 * its hosted MCP server (https://api.scite.ai/mcp) has three access paths
 * (see https://docs.scite.ai/mcp) — the first-party ChatGPT/Claude
 * plugin/connector (OAuth, those platforms only), an interactive MCP client
 * doing OAuth 2.1 + PKCE (DSH has no such flow), and the documented
 * programmatic path: an `mcp`-scoped API key from the API Console
 * (scite.ai/users/me/api), sent as a bearer token to `/mcp` with no token
 * exchange. That third path is what SCITE_API_KEY uses below — it's Scite's
 * own first-class non-interactive credential, not a workaround.
 *
 * Consensus is NOT here: it moved off its MCP server to a plain REST API
 * with `x-api-key` auth, so it's now `consensus-search.js` — a native
 * per-call tool, not a standing MCP mount, which also means a
 * Settings-changed CONSENSUS_API_KEY takes effect on the next call rather
 * than needing a restart. See presets/researchcraft/agent.cordis.yml.
